Title : Classification of Glacier Radar Zone and Glacier Velocity Mapping in Pine Islands Using Google Earth Engine and ITS_LIVE

This project involved the use of Sentinel-1 C Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to delineate radar glacier zones for the year 2015. The analysis was conducted using the Random Forest classifier implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Additionally, glacier velocity data from the ITS_LIVE project was explored to complement the analysis.
